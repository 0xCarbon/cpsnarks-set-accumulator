initSidebarItems({"fn":[["is_prob_prime","Implements the Baillie-PSW probabilistic primality test, which is known to be deterministic over all integers up to 64 bits (u64). Offers more bang for your buck than Miller-Rabin (i.e. iterated Fermat tests of random base) at wide `n` since Fermat and Lucas pseudoprimes have been shown to be anticorrelated. Steps of BPSW are as follows: 1. Accept small primes and reject multiples of them. 2. Do a single iteration of Miller-Rabin (base-2 Fermat test). 3. Do a strong probabilistic Lucas test (squares filtered during test initialization)."],["passes_lucas","Strong Lucas probable prime test (NOT the more common Lucas primality test which requires factorization of `n-1`)."],["passes_miller_rabin_base_2","A single iteration of the Miller-Rabin test."]]});
